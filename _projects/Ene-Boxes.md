Ene and the magic boxes is a beautifully illustrated tale about a little mouse called Ene in the quest to find music for their friends. Ene has to overcome the challenge of not having instruments, and so comes up with a novel design to bring music to the house. With creativity and curiosity, Ene is able to bring happiness to the house whilst learning all about carpenters, chefs, and artists.

This little story is ideal to introduce little ones to artisanâ€™s workspaces, and over 50 new words in their trade. Moreover, the visual dictionary presented will entertain young minds when learning new vocabulary and finding objects in the boxes.
