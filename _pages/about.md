``After receiving her degree of Licenciada en Matem√°ticas from the University of La Plata, she obtained her DPhil from the University of Oxford. After graduation she was post-doctoral researcher at the University of Heidelberg and the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.  She moved to Chicago to take up a faculty position at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in 2015, where she is currently an Associate Professor. 

Laura's research focuses on the study of the geometry and topology of the moduli spaces of decorated bundles, especially Higgs bundles and Hitchin systems, and geometric structures they parametrize.  Research on 
the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles has yielded connections between fundamental areas of mathematics and theoretical physics, blending ideas from algebraic and differential geometry, Lie theory, representation theory, and string theory. Her work has appeared in the Journal of Differential Geometry, Transactions of the AMS, Communications in Mathematical Physics, Advances in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics,  Proceedings of the Royal Society A, among other outlets."
