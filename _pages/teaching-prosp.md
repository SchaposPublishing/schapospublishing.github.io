<h2>Information for students and post-docs</h2>

<b>Post-doc positions for German based researchers:</b> If you are based in Germany and would like to work as a post-doctoral researcher with me, please send me an email at schapos@uic.edu. The Alexander von Humboldt foundation has a program through which you could come to UIC for 1~2 years. 


<b>Post-doc positions opening:</b> In 2021/2022 I will be hiring one or two post-docs to work in my research group at UIC. If you're interested in joining me here, please send me an email. 


<b>Students at UIC:</b> If you’re a student at UIC and looking for research in my area, don’t hesitate to get in touch by emailing me at schapos@uic.edu. 


<b>Student openings:</b> If you're interested in joining UIC to work in my research group, do get in touch! I can walk you through the application process and help you prepare your material. 

For some global as well as particular open problems in my area, students may enjoy reading about [spectral Higgs bundles](http://aimpl.org/spectralhiggs/1/) from one of the [workshops](https://schapos.people.uic.edu/Research.html) that I organized.
