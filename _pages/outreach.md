### Sonia Kovalevsky Days

These days are part of series of the [Association of Women in Mathematics (AWM)](https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/home). For more than twenty years Sonia Kovalevsky Days have been organized and sponsored by AWM and held at colleges and universities throughout the country. Sonia Kovalevsky Days (SK Days) consist of a program of workshops, talks, and problem-solving competitions for female high school and middle school students and their teachers, both women and men.

### MIT PRIMES-USA

Since 2014, I have been wirking with MIT through their [PRIMES program]().

<b>Vishaal Ram</b> |  Soon to become an undergraduate at ...
- Supervised through PRIMES-USA (MIT) during 2020 (High School)
- 2020 S.-T. Yau High School Science Bronze Award.
- Regeneron Science Talent Search Scholar 2020.

<b>Yuyuan Luo</b> |   Currently undergraduate at MIT.
- Supervised through PRIMES-USA (MIT) during 2019 (High School)
- JMM Outstanding Poster Presentation Award (2020). 

<b>Rinni Bhansali</b>  | Currently undergraduate at Stanford University.
- Supervised during 2018 through MIT's PRIMES-USA program
- Project: A trust model for bootstrap percolation
- Regeneron Science Talent Search Scholar (2018).

We develop a trust model which when considered together with bootstrap percolation, allows one to study ways in which gossip (and fake news) spread in social networks.

Symmetries in nature have been long studied by mathematicians, and in this project we shall be looking at particular cases of natural symmetries: the ones appearing in viral infections....

<b>Kai Siang-Ang</b> | Currently undergraduate at Stanford University.
- Supervised during 2016 through MIT's PRIMES-USA program. 
- Project: On the geometry of regular icosahedral capsids containing disymmetrons
- Regeneron Science Talent Search Scholar (2016).
- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08271)

Icosahedral virus capsids are composed of symmetrons, organized arrangements of capsomers. In the present paper we incorporate disymmetrons to obtain a geometric classification of icosahedral viruses formed by regular penta-, tri-, and disymmetrons.  

<b>Jessica Li</b> |  Currently undergraduate at Harvard University.
- Supervised during 2014 through MIT's PRIMES-USA program.
- Interface control and snow crystal growth
- Siemens Semifinalist (2014).
- Intel Competition Semifinalist (2014). 
- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02042)

The growth of snow crystals is dependent on the temperature and saturation of the environment. By defining two new variables, growth latency and growth direction, our improved model gives a realistic model not only for dendrite but also for plate forms.
