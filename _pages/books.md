In the last few years my priorities and time allocations shifted slightly, and the <i>human development<i> of little bodies that orbit us has taken one of the first sports in my priority list. In an attempt to combine this with my research and the educator inside me,  I decided to start writing and illustrating children books. 

## Ene and the Magicâ€¦ Books 

Ene is a curious little mouse who explores magic places and discovers new worlds. Through the adventures of Ene, I hope to teach bilingual words (Spanish-Englis) on different topics. 
I am working on these books in collaboration with [Cecilia La Rosa](https://www.instagram.com/cecilialarosa.ilus/) (Illustrator).

### Ene and the Magic Boxes

Our first book <b> Ene and the Magic Boxes <b>  is a beautifully illustrated tale about a little mouse called Ene in the quest to find music for their friends. With creativity and curiosity, Ene is able to bring happiness to the house whilst learning all about carpenters, chefs, and artists.
