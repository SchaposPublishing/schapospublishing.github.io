 <h1 id="raccoon">Raccoon's adventures  </h1>
 

Together with illustrator [Martina Rusznak](https://tinarusznak.com/) we are working on a couple of projects, the first one of which will lead to our first publication together coming mid 2022.

### Raccoon's difficult day

Our first book <b> Raccoon's difficult day</b> is a book about overcoming difficulties that one encounters daily, changing perspective to turn things our way, and building a <i>map to a better day</i> to be used next time a day seems to start in a difficult way.
