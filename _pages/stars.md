## [Reaching for the stars (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1737058472/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_4P5WBNZJMAVM0E3M977K?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)

 
My husband [James Unwin](https://unwin.people.uic.edu/James_Unwin.html) wrote his first children's book in 2021 titled  <b>Reaching for the Stars</b>,  illustrated by mathematician [Maylis Limouzineau](https://lucky8locke.ultra-book.com/). It is an engaging story about a cat that goes through several transformations on their journey to become a star in the sky. Children and adults will love to read and reread this beautiful illustrated tale featuring Cats, Tigers, Zebras and Reindeer. A thrilling journey of self-discovery that teaches children the importance of having the courage to follow their dreams and to become their best selves.

I had the honor of translating the book to Spanish whilst preserving the beautiful rhyme, making the book available in Spanish and English, as well as in a bilingual version.
