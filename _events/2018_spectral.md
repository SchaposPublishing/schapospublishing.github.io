# Current trends on spectral data for Higgs bundles IV

**Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford**

*November 17-18 2018*

Higgs bundles and their spectral data have had applications in different research areas of mathematics and physics. This fourth  workshop in the series   is intended to bring young researchers in the area to highlight advances in their research, and inspire new perspectives from which to study Higgs bundles and its applications. 

The speakers will include:

* Qiongling Li, Caltech/Aarhus, USA/Denmark.
* Sara Maloni, Virginia, USA.
* Camilla Felisetti, Bologna, Italy.
* Victoria Hoskins, FU Berlin, Germany.
* Nigel Hitchin, Oxford, UK.
* Monica Kang, Harvard, USA.
* Sergei Gukov, Caltech, USA.
* Eloise Hamilton, Oxford, UK
