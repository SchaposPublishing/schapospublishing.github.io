# Current trends on spectral data for Higgs bundles V

**Simons Center for Geometry and Physics**

*May 25-26 2019*

Higgs bundles and their spectral data have had applications in different research areas of mathematics and physics. This fifth  workshop in the series is intended to bring young researchers in the area to highlight advances in their research, and inspire new perspectives from which to study Higgs bundles and its applications. 

The speakers will include:

* Emily Cliff, UIUC, USA.
* Eloise Hamilton, Oxford, UK
* Yu-Chien Huang, MIT, USA 
* Sara Maloni, Virginia, USA.
* Natalie Paquette, Caltech, USA.
