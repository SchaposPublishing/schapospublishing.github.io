# Current trends on spectral data for Higgs bundles I

**American Institute of Mathematics, Palo Alto, California, USA.**

*September 25-27, 2015*

Higgs bundles and their spectral data have had applications in different research areas of mathematics and physics. This first workshop in the series was intended to bring young researchers in the area to highlight advances in their research, and inspire new perspectives from which to study Higgs bundles and its applications. 

The speakers were:

* Lara Anderson, Virginia Tech, USA.
* Lucas Branco, University of Oxford, UK.
* Olivia Dumitrescu, Leibniz Universit채t Hannover, Germany.
* Laura Fredrickson, The University of Texas at Austin, USA.
* Victoria Hoskins, Freie Universit채t Berlin, Germany.
* Marina Logares, ICMAT, Spain.
