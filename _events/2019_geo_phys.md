**Simons Center for Geometry and Physics (SCGP)**

*March 2019*

This workshop, fourth in a series of Graduate workshops on Higgs bundles, is aimed at graduate students and young postdocs, will expose participants to some current research topics on the geometry and physics of Higgs bundles. The workshop will have two mini-courses by experts on topics close to their own research, including a mix of lectures and problem sessions.

For any questions regarding the meeting, please email
