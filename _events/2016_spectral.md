# Current trends on spectral data for Higgs bundles II

**Simons Center for Geometry and Physics, Stony Brooke, New York, USA.**

*June 11-12, 2016*

Higgs bundles and their spectral data have had applications in different research areas of mathematics and physics. This second  workshop in the series was intended to bring young researchers in the area to highlight advances in their research, and inspire new perspectives from which to study Higgs bundles and its applications. The speakers were:

* Laura Fredrickson, The University of Texas at Austin, USA.
* Victoria Hoskins, Freie Universit√§t Berlin, Germany.
* Alessia Mandini, PUC, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
* Sara Maloni, Brown University, USA.
* Daniele Alessandrini, University of Heidelberg, Germany.
* Arielle Leitner, Technion, Israel.
* Qiongling Li, QGM Aarhus & Caltech, Denmark & US

This workshop was co-organized with Lara Anderson.
