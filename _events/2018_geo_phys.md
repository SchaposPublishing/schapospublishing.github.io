# RTG Workshop on the Geometry and Physics of Higgs bundles III

**University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)**

*June 2018*

This workshop, third in a series of Graduate workshops on Higgs bundles, is aimed at graduate students and young postdocs, will expose participants to some current research topics on the geometry and physics of Higgs bundles. The workshop will have two mini-courses by experts on topics close to their own research, including a mix of lectures and problem sessions.
