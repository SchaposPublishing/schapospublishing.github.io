This workshop, aimed at graduate students and young postdocs, will expose participants to some current research topics on the geometry and physics of Higgs bundles. The workshop will have two mini-courses by experts on topics close to their own research, including a mix of lectures and problem sessions. On Friday afternoon we will have an introductory lecture.
